Program to automatically check if a new grade has been published using genote, a website my school uses.

# Installation
This is a "cog" for the Discord RedBot (see: https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). You need to have a working installation of RedBot to use this.

When fist running the bot, a config file will be created. You need to change the file's content and fill it with your Genote's credidentials.
